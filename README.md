# FINETUNING LANGUAGE MODELS DOCUMENTATION

### Milestone 1
For the projects first milestone I learned the basics of docker and created a development environment on Windows 11. The steps to install docker can be found in the milestone-1 branch README file

### Milestone 2
For the projects second milestone I created a new branch titled milestone-2 and merged it to the main branch. I then used the following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hOzsFETm4I&ab_channel=1littlecoder to help me create a web app using the streamlit library as well as the transformers library. The web app is titled "Sentiment Analysis App" and it's functionality allows it to input text and select a model to receive the corresponding sentiment analysis result. This was done with the help of the pretrained models, 'bert-base-uncased', 'distilroberta-base', 'xlm-roberta-base', and 't5-base', on HuggingFaces. 


### Milestone 3
For this milestone I used this youtube video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSt00_-0ncQ&t=312s&ab_channel=PatrickLoeber, to finetune a language model using the HuggingFace transformers library. This dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge, was used to develop the required classifier. This finetuned model was then supposed to be used to detect different types of toxicity and then used in a webapp deployed of HuggingFace Spaces where the app is populated with a dropdown menu to select my fine tuned model. This is still a personal work in progress as I am unable to complete the training of the model due to it constantly crashing overnight. 

### Milestone 4
For the fourth and final milestone for my project, I added descriptive comments to the code in each branch for documentation, created this README, and created a youtube video [insert link here] to demonstrate the web apps I created for the project.
